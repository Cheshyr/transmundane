Transmundane - Intuitive Magic

Cast spells, learn spells. Improve in true Elder Scroll fashion.

Automatically discover spells based on the School or Aspect of the spells you cast. Spend Aspect Experience to learn specific or hybrid Aspect spells. Read Spell Tomes to gain XP towards learning a specific spell, and keep the book afterwards.

Learn in Combat. Learn in Bed. Train yourself, or buy a library. Focus an Aspect, or see what your adventures and playstyle teach you.

Features:
 - Passively learn spells by casting spells from a specific School. All spells with a school can be learned via School... eventually.
 - Passively learn spells by casting spells from a specific Aspect. Only some spells can be learned by Aspect, but learn those spells sooner.
 - School learning and Aspect learning happen simultaneously and automatically.  
 - Actively learn spells from your personal Spell Atlas once you have the skill and Aspect Experience. All spells can be researched in your Spell Atlas.
 - Spell Tomes no longer instantly teach Adept and stronger spells. Instead, they grant XP towards that spell. You can read multiple tomes, or practice to make up the difference.
 - Support for most major Spell Mods, with no patching required. Unsupported mods behave normally.
 - High performance scripting; all script features profiled and optimized.
 - Adjustable learning rates via Console, and maybe MCM if I get around to it.
 - SKSE _not_ required.
